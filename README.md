“To make a Smart Agriculture System and simulate the
same using Internet Of things and Machine Learning.”
The main motive of this project is going to simplify the process
of irrigation and getting the best possible conditions for farmers
for their agricultural processes.

The project we have developed helps farmers by sensing the soil moisture and switching the
pump automatically when the power is ‘ON’. This helps is watering the soil, incase the soil
moisture sensor is low. Along with that we have also made a machine learning model to predict
and analyse the condition of soil and plants for our fellow farmers. We have also done an IFTTT
integration to our project which sends mail to farmers if the moisture falls below a certain
threshold and help them to make accurate decisions and make their crops and plants healthier
with changing climate and soil situations.

Arduino codes in the folder can be uploaded in an arduino UNO for both automation and data collection along 
with the sensors connected to it. The ipynb code file contains the data analysis and the machine learning part 
of the project which can work on jupyter notebook or collab using the data.xlsx collected through the sensors.
