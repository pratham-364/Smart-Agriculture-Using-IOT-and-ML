# To make a Smart Agriculture System and simulate the same using Internet Of things and Machine Learning.
**The main motive of this project is going to simplify the process of irrigation and getting the best possible conditions for farmers for their agricultural processes.**

> This project that we developed helps farmers by sensing the soil moisture and switching the pump automatically when the power is ‘ON’. This helps is watering the soil, incase the soil moisture sensor is low. Along with that we have also made a machine learning model to predict and analyse the condition of soil and plants for our fellow farmers. We have also done an IFTTT integration to our project which sends mail to farmers if the moisture falls below a certain threshold and help them to make accurate decisions and make their crops and plants healthier with changing climate and soil situations.

> Arduino codes in the folder can be uploaded in an arduino UNO for both automation and data collection along with the sensors connected to it. The ipynb code file contains the data analysis and the machine learning part of the project which can work on jupyter notebook or collab using the data.xlsx collected through the sensors.
